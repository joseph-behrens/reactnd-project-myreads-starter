# MyReads Project

This is my updated code from the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

To the project locally:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web brower to interact with the application

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
